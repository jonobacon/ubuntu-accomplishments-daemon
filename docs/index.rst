Welcome!

Welcome to the Ubuntu Accomplishments Daemon documentation!

This documentation provides two references:

 * **Ubuntu Accomplishments Client API Reference** - for both the client-facing documentation (of most interest to those writing client-side apps or support for Ubuntu Accomplishments in their apps) as well as

 * **Ubuntu Accomplishments Daemon Reference** - documentation designed for programmers of the core Ubuntu Accomplishments system (not intended for client or app devs).
